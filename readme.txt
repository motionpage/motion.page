Move it like it's HOT!

== Description ==

With Motion.page for WordPress, you can animate anything you can imagine without writing a single line of code, in a fully visual builder.

== Installation ==

After the purchase of one of our plans, download the plugin from the member's area, and follow the basic process.

1. Download the plugin
2. Install the plugin by uploading the zip file to Plugins > Add New
3. You will see the new "Motion.page" link at bottom of the WP sidebar, which launches the builder
4. Launch the builder, and add your license key on the welcome screen, to activate it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this plugin work? =

It's a motion builder packed with powerful features. It brings a world of professional web animation into WordPress, with a UI that provides a smooth workflow. Install the plugin, launch the builder and animate any page from your site!

= What can I do with it? =

Create a simple animation or a complex timeline with multiple elements animated at different times. Attach your animation to prebuilt triggers like on load, page exit, scroll, click or hover, and create the ultimate website experience without writing any code.

= Does it affect performance? =

Motion.page was built with performance in mind from day one. Assets are conditionally loaded only on pages where they are used. It doesn't add more code than manually coded animations.

= What about CLS? =

Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) will not be affected on any animated elements above the fold. If animations use transform properties, they are perfectly ok for Core Web Vitals.
